# DailyMemories

By building this sample app, we will go through 3 ways of adding machine learning to your apps:

1. [*master*] **Core ML**  to classify scene detection
2. [*add-face-detection*] **Vision**  to perform face detection
3. [*add-facial-expression-classification*] **coremltools** + **Core ML** to use a custom machine learning model for facial expression recognition

Each of these parts of the sample app correspond to a branch in this repository

# Part 1 - Add 

1. Make sure you're on the `master` branch. If not,
`git checkout master`
